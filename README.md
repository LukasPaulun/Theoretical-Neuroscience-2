Contains the module neurons.py which can be used to
  - create a√∂dlkfj
See the file example.py for an example of how to create Poisson neurons, generate spike trains, connect them to an LIF neuron and simulate its membrane potential.

# Connect with colab
Colab notebooks that import the module neurons.py from this repository can be created from the template colab_template.ipynb.
